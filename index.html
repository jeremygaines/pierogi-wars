		<p><b>Truck vs. City</b></p>
		<p>While working as a cook at Park Grill in Chicago, inspiration struck Damian Warzecha, who owns and operates Pierogi Wagon.</p>
		<p>"It's a festival-like kind of environment," Warzecha said of his food truck business. "I always enjoyed that."</p>
		<p>Pierogi Wagon serves only pierogi, a traditional Polish dish of fried dumplings stuffed with a variety of ingredients. </p>
		<p>Following through on his idea was initially harder than Warzecha expected. While the upkeep and operation of the food truck were straightforward, Damian didn't anticipate the upfront cost of the truck. If he were opening a traditional restaurant, the lease would give him the opportunity to generate profit before having to pay. With the food truck, he had to pay up front for the truck. This didn't stop Damian, though. Instead, he took to Kickstarter to crowdfund the financing of the truck and raised $613 past his $15,000 goal.</p>

		<p><b>Truck vs. Restaurant</b></p>
		<p>The nature of competition with brick and mortar restaurants, however, is more complicated.</p>
		<p>"For example there is another restaurant close by [where?]. It's legal parking for us so we park there, but I know the restaurant owner is not happy with food trucks being next to him because he's empty and we're having lines. It's all because of what we serve and what he serves."</p>
		<p>There are laws that seek to level the playing field. Food trucks may not stop within 200 feet of a restaurant. The process of owning a food truck is complicated by regulations and high costs [going out on a limb] "I thought that would be cheaper than opening a restaurant. It's actually more expensive, but I thought it would be cheaper."</p>
		<p>Warzecha said he competes with brick and mortar restaurants for customers, including another business that specializes in pierogis, Pierogi Heaven.</p>
		<p>The original Pierogi Heaven is situated in the Loop, with a second location just a few blocks from the first. Located on N. Wells St. in Chicago, the restaurant aims to serve up the best of traditional Polish dishes. </p>
		<p>The restaurant is open six days a week until 7 p.m., and caters mainly to a lunch crowd. The 11 pierogi flavors come as plates of six, nine or 12 pieces, with fillings from cheddar and potato to a mix of strawberries, plums, blueberries and cherries. The staff tops them with a hearty dose of fried onions, bacon and sour cream</p>
		<p>The Pierogi Heaven staff sees its biggest rush at lunch, much like Pierogi Wagon. They're competing for the same regulars when the truck is in the same area as the restaurant. They get the business crowd from buildings nearby at Pierogi Heaven, while Pierogi Wagon finds itself constantly on the move, with its clientele changing each day. </p>
		<p>Warzecha said he's doesn't worry too much about the competition. </p>	
		<p>"It's an open market," he said. "If you have good food, people are going to come to you." </p>

		<p>The key advantage to a food truck is mobility, Warzecha said. If a location stops being profitable, he can move, unlike a restaurant which lives and dies by its location.</p>
		<p>"How do I choose the location? Money." Warzecha said. "We go to places where there's money, where's there's people, where we are expected."</p>
		<p>Warzecha considers other food trucks as a positive, not as competition. "The more food trucks in one spot, the more people come to the trucks. It becomes a magnet. If people see many choices, it's easier for them to stop by."</p>
		<p>"If you go to a place where no one has ever seen a food truck before, you're going to sell five portions," Warzecha said. "It takes time to develop a location. It takes time to train the market. You have to have people understand that you are coming here on a regular basis, and that's how you build the lines, and that's how you get regular customers." </p>
